I am a final year undergraduate at the Computer Science and Engineering department of [IIT Bombay](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/). I am interested in artificial intelligence, including reinforcement learning, multi-armed bandits and NLP.

I'm currently doing my Bachelors' Thesis Project (BTP) with Prof. [Preethi Jyothi](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pjyothi/) in machine learning techniques for low resource languages. I have worked with Prof. [Shivaram Kalyanarkishnan](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~shivaram) on election forecasting, and in proving PAC guarantees for mode estimation and multi-armed bandits. Since December 2020, I have been working on the evaluation and testing of Google and Bing's QnA systems, guided by Prof. [Pinjia He](https://pinjiahe.github.io/) and Prof. [Zhendong Su](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/suz/). In the summer of 2021, I interned with the Global Talent Acquisition Team at Microsoft , working on automated resume shortlisting.
