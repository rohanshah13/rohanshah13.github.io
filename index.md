Hi! I am Rohan, and I'm a fourth-year undergraduate at the Computer Science and Engineering department of [IIT Bombay](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/).
I am currently primarily interested in machine learning but I find many facets of computer science fascinating.

I'm currently doing my Bachelors' Thesis Project (BTP) with Prof. [Preethi Jyothi](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pjyothi/) in machine learning for low resource languages. 
In the summer of 2021, I was a data science intern at Microsoft India, where I worked on vision-language models for Bing Ads classification with [Swati Tiwari](https://www.linkedin.com/in/swati-tiwari-1805/) under [Neelesh Khanna](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nekhanna/).
The summer before, I was exploring Vector Addition Systems as a research intern at ETH Zurich, guided by Prof. [Zhendong Su](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/suz/) and Prof. [Pinjia He](https://pinjiahe.github.io/). 

<!-- You can find some of my writings [here](https://akkapakasaikiran.github.io/archive.html).
I hope the existence of this site will spur me on to pen down my thoughts more.  -->
